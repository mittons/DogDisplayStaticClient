## About
If this is not too long it can also just be the intro part... if so:
    - [ ] then we have to remove tihs
    - [ ] and remove from table of contents


## Versioning

<details> <summary> Click to EXPAND/COLLAPSE my outloud thoughts. However, your time is probably worth more than reading, decoding and processing the expanded data. </summary>  (With my current roadmap.. nope nope nope, not a version every commit like in the other dog repos. Not like I'd do it for every project anyways, or any project after the dog projects for that matter. Decisions depends on context ofc.) 

Actually.. this might be a good chance to practice being selective in which commits get a version number. I should read up on the semantic versioning system for a second before i start versioning this project.

I paste this here for reference:

#### Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/mittons/IveChosenTheIntentToSeekPandorasHopeAsMyChains-OfAllChoices-ThatOne-IfItIsEvenUpToMe-ThatChoise-IsMyFirstChoiceForChoisesToForgo--IWillSeekHope--InPerpetuity-Or-UntilNoOneLacksChoice-IChooseChains-RejectFreedom-AtleastUntil-UntilNoHumanHasChainsTheyDidNotChoose-ThenIMightReevaluate---ButUntilTheseConditionsAreMet-IRejectTheChoiceToChangeMyDecision-IChooseChains-IRejectFreedom---MyDevotionInLifeIsRealizingPandorasHope--AndIHaveNoChoice--NotAnyMore-NotUntilTheTaskIsFinished/tags).
